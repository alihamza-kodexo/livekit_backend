"""Call recording: LiveKit Egress to a local file, then Cloudinary.

Two hops rather than one, because Egress can only upload to S3, GCS, Azure or
AliOSS -- Cloudinary is not among them and has no S3-compatible endpoint. So
Egress writes the mixed audio to a directory shared between its container and
this worker, and once the file is finalised the worker uploads it and throws the
local copy away. `CLOUDINARY_*` was already in .env.example waiting for this.

Everything here is best-effort by design. A call that happened is worth more
than a recording of it, so no failure in this module is allowed to reach the
caller or fail the call log: a missing recording writes NULL to
`call_logs.recording_url`, exactly as before this existed, and says why in the
worker log.

Recording is opt-in (`CALL_RECORDING_ENABLED`) for a reason beyond caution about
cost. Recording an inbound PSTN call carries consent obligations that vary by
jurisdiction, and only the deployment's owner knows which apply -- so switching
it on is a deliberate act, and whoever does it is the one deciding the greeting
in flow.py says whatever their jurisdiction requires.
