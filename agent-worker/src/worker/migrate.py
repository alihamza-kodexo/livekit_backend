"""One command to bring a Supabase database up to date: `python -m worker.migrate`.

Why this exists
---------------
Standing the schema up meant pasting 26 files into the SQL editor in the right
order, which is slow, easy to get wrong, and offers no way to tell afterwards
what actually ran. It also produced the failure we hit in production twice:
code deployed ahead of its schema, `insert_call_log` swallowing the resulting
error (see supabase_client.py), and whole call records disappearing with only a
log line to show for it. A migrate step that runs before the worker restarts
removes that class of bug outright.

Why not a single hand-written schema.sql
----------------------------------------
It is tempting -- one file, one paste, done -- and it is a trap. It becomes a
27th definition of the schema that has to be kept in step with the 26 files by
hand, and the day it drifts is the day a fresh install stops matching
production. The files in supabase/migrations are already the definition; this
just runs them, in order, in seconds. A fresh database gets all 26 applied in
one go, which is the "single script" part, without inventing a second source of
truth.

The three states a database can be in
-------------------------------------
Detected rather than asked about, because getting it wrong by hand is what
makes this dangerous:

  FRESH    no schema_migrations, no `agents` table -- an empty project. Apply
           everything.
  UNTRACKED  no schema_migrations, but `agents` exists -- a database that was
           set up by hand before this runner existed, which is exactly what
           production is. Applying 0001 to it would fail on the first CREATE.
           Refused unless --adopt is passed, which records the migrations as
           applied *without running them*.
  TRACKED  schema_migrations exists -- apply whatever is missing.

Safety
------
* One transaction per migration. Postgres DDL is transactional, so a file that
  fails half way leaves nothing behind.
* A session advisory lock, so two workers starting together can't both run it.
* Each file's sha256 is recorded, so a migration edited after it was applied is
  reported instead of quietly diverging.
* Only 3 of the 26 files use `if not exists`; the rest would error on a second
  run. That is fine because each runs exactly once -- but it is also why a
  partially-applied database is refused rather than retried.

Usage
-----
    python -m worker.migrate --dry-run     # what would run, changes nothing
    python -m worker.migrate               # apply pending
    python -m worker.migrate --adopt       # existing DB: record, don't run

Needs SUPABASE_DB_URL (the Postgres connection string, not the REST URL --
DDL cannot go through PostgREST). Optionally ADMIN_EMAIL, which is added to
allowed_users so somebody can actually sign in to a fresh install; migrations
0003/0004 seed Kodexo's own addresses and a new deployment needs its own.
